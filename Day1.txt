Here, we create a stored procedure with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE SQL statements. 
The SELECT SQL statement is used to fetch rows from a database table. The INSERT statement is used to add new rows to a table. 
The UPDATE statement is used to edit and update the values of an existing record. 
The DELETE statement is used to delete records from a database table.
The following SQL stored procedure is used insert, update, delete, 
and select rows from a table, depending on the statement type parameter.    

create PROCEDURE miud (@A INTEGER,
                      @B VARCHAR(10),
                      @c VARCHAR(10),
                      @StatementType NVARCHAR(20) = '')
AS
  BEGIN
      IF @StatementType = 'Insert'
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO Table_1
                        (A,
                         B,
                         c)
            VALUES     ( @A,
                         @B,
                         @c)
        END

      IF @StatementType = 'Select'
        BEGIN
            SELECT *
            FROM Table_1
        END

      IF @StatementType = 'Update'
        BEGIN
            UPDATE Table_1
            SET    A=@A,
